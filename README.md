Solus Operating System 3rd Party Source Repo
===

This repo contains the build files required to create packages that cannot
be redistributed, whether for licensing restrictions or otherwise.

DO NOT PUSH BINARY PACKAGES. The git history has been reset because it ballooned
to nearly 300MB in size. :)
